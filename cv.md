##Briefly About Myself:

I am interested in web development because I have always wondered what a website is like, its ergonomics and user experience. I always wanted to change a certain block on the website that is out of place.

I am eager to thoroughly study a discipline that is new to me, relying on a huge amount of quality material on the Internet for self-training, as well as the course of the developer community. I am easy to learn and ready to learn new things, and then apply the new knowledge gained in practice, improving the quality of web sites.

Graduated from the Belarusian National Technical University with a degree in power engineering. Graduated from the Center for Franco-Belarusian Studies at the French Embassy in Belarus with a degree in General European Law. Studied DevOps basics in EPAM online courses.

Currently working as an automation engineer in the energy sector, I have in-depth knowledge in the field of communication equipment and its interaction with microprocessor industrial controllers.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
